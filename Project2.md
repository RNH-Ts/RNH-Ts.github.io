**Look what one hour of Excel can do!**  
This simple placeholder project takes a raw dataset, cleans it, builds pivot tables, graphs, and KPIs, and wraps it all into a compact dashboard. Nothing fancy. Just the basics.

### Bike Sales Dashboard Project Highlights

- **Pivot Tables:** segment customer data dynamically  
- **Dashboards:** consolidate tables and charts for quick insight  
- **KPIs:** summarize key metrics to support business decisions

The analysis focused on questions such as:

- Which income groups are more likely to purchase a bike?  
- Does commute distance affect purchasing behavior?  
- Are specific age groups stronger target segments?  
- How do demographic factors shape buying patterns?  

Through segmentation and KPI analysis, the dashboard highlights patterns in customer behavior and demonstrates how Excel can be used as a practical business intelligence tool.

Age groups were created using conditional logic in Excel to segment customers into analytical brackets (e.g., 18–30, 31–50, 51+).

### Dashboard Interactivity

The dashboard includes interactive filters (region, maritial status, or education) that let viewers explore patterns dynamically. Using these filters shows how flexible Excel dashboards can adapt to different business questions, highlighting trends even in simple data sets. For instance, in this set, the Europe and North America regions do differ quite noticeably from each other.
