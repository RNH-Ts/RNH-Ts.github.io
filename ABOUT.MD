# About Me

My journey to **Data Analysis** might not be the traditional route, but it has been a very organic one. In every role I’ve held, I’ve been driven to go beyond surface tasks and analyze how they fit in the **big picture**, uncovering insights and deeper understanding.

## From Language to Systems Thinking

I began my career teaching English, but immediately felt hemmed in by prestige and prescriptivism. English is used all over the world in many different — but equally valid — varieties. This sparked a curiosity in me about language, not as a set of rules, but as a system, and especially multiple languages as a system within one person.

This curiosity led me to a **Master’s degree in European Linguistics** at the University of Freiburg. During this time, I also worked as a research assistant with large English corpora. Analyzing real-world language data — which often contradicted textbook rules — showed me firsthand how powerful large datasets can be in reflecting reality.

## From Projects to Data-Driven Decisions

After my studies, I worked as an editor at **Hueber**, managing complex textbook projects with many moving parts, stakeholders, and deadlines. While I thrived in project management, I missed the **data-driven analysis** I had grown to love. Too often, decisions were guided by preference rather than evidence.

## Transition into Data Analytics

During my parental leave, I had time to reflect on my career path and recognized where my **natural analytical tendencies** were leading me. I made a conscious shift toward **tech and data analytics**, learning to code as another language to uncover patterns, challenge assumptions, and contribute to broader understanding.

My background positions me as a **bridge between analysis and language**, able to communicate complex processes and insights clearly across languages and formats.
