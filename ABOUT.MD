# About Me

My journey to Data Analysis might not be the traditional route, but but it’s been one driven by curiosity that has developed organically. In every role I’ve held, I’ve been driven to go beyond surface tasks and analyze how they fit in the context of the big picture, to gain greater insights and understanding.

## From Language Teaching to Systems Thinking

I began my career teaching English, but at times felt hemmed in by prestige and prescriptivism. English is used all over the world in many different, but equally valid, varieties. This sparked a deeper curiosity in me about language, not as a set of rules one SHOULD follow, but as a system in and of itself, functioning just fine without our opinions. Especially the idea of multiple languages as one system within a person, fascinated me. 

That curiosity led me to a Master’s degree in European Linguistics at the University of Freiburg, where in addition to my studies, I began work as a research assistant with large English Corpora. Analyzing real world language data, which had no problem contradicting textbook rules, showed me first hand what a powerful tool large data sets can be in reflecting reality.

## From Projects to Data-Driven Decisions

After my studies, I worked as an editor at Hueber, managing big textbook projects with lots of moving parts, actors and various deadlines. While I thrived in the complexity of project management, I missed the data-driven analysis I had grown to love. Too often, decisions were guided by preference over evidence.

## Transition into Data Analytics

During my parental leave, I had time to reassess my career and understand where this natural analytical tendency was leading me. I made a conscious shift toward tech and data analytics. Learning to code was just another language at the end of the day. Using data to uncover patterns, challenge assumptions and add it to the general understanding is where my strengths align. 

This analytical mindset, honed through linguistics and project management, is exactly what drives my approach to data analysis today. My background positions me as a bridge between analysis and language, able to communicate complex processes and insights clearly across languages and formats. My skill set includes Python-based data analysis in Jupyter Notebooks, SQL querying, Power BI dashboarding, and a growing interest in large language models informed by my linguistics background.
